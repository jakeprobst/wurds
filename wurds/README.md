## wurds

wurds is a lightweight library that models a game similar to [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

The library does not offer much in terms of customization -- it makes some key assumptions such as:

- puzzle/guess word length is always 5 letters
- the user always has 6 turns to guess the word
